PyConZA Funding application form
================================

Intended to integrate with `wafer`_.

.. _wavfer: (https://github.com/CTPUG/wafer).

About
=====

This is a funding application that can be used with wafer. It is fairly minimal
and specific to how PyCon ZA handles funding, but can be adapted for other
conferences.

Installing
==========

This is not a standalone application, but intended to extend wafer.

1. Add pyconza-funding to the requirements.txt file of the conference application.
2. Add funding to the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` of your site, before any of the ``wafer`` applications.
